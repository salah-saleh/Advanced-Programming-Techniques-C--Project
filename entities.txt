# BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FILE FORMAT FOLLOWS:

# General white space is used to separate tokens within a line, 
# you can therefore directly use I/O streams to separate them.
# Like white space, everything after fence should be ignored (comments).
#
# A line is either empty (only white space and comments),
# or it contains a valid description of a unique unit or building.
# Your program must report invalid lines, it can fail with an appropriate error message.
# Some examples follow
	 	
# The previous line contains some white space, so it is fine.
  # This line is a comment with trailing white space, also fine.
# The following line is empty, which is as fine as any other line in this document.

# The first columns of descriptions are mandatory. A description consists of:
 # 1:  The name (unique ID) of the unit or building.
 # 2:  How much Psi (support) it provides. Usually 0 for units.
 # 3:  How much Psi (support) it requires. Usually 0 for buildings.
 # 4:  How much minerals are consumed for production.
 # 5:  How much Vespin gas is consumed for production.
 # 6:  How many seconds / time steps the production takes.
 # 7:  A production site: For a Probe, e.g., _one_ Nexus is occupied for 17 seconds / time steps.
 #     A dash indicates that no site is occupied. 
 # 8: Optional enumeration of dependencies. Additional to the dependencies in the Techtree, 
 #     we added artificial dependencies for everything that consumes Vespin gas on Assimilators.
#
# Columns 1 to 6 are mandatory, columns 8 and further are optional.
# Column 7 can be made mandatory, too, but you may allow for an 
# empty 7th column (no producer, no dependencies).
